# Stylish-Themes
Collection of [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) Themes created/maintained by myself

Themes are organized into folders named the site, then theme name. Each theme is a `.css` file named after the version number

Example:
A version of a theme "Pickletastic" for http://example.com released on April 1st, 2016 would be stored as `example.com/Pickletastic/v16.04.1.css`

If thee theme affects multiple sites (unlikely), then the top folder may simply be named after the site owner (Example instead of example.com would be multiple example-owned websites) `Example/Pickletastic/v16.04.1.css`

So in short
`Company or Site/Theme Name/Version.css`
