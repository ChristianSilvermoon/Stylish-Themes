# Stylish-Themes
Collection of User Styles created/maintained by myself

I do **NOT** recommend the use of Stylish, as it has been reported to have been recording all URLs visited by Users.
Please ignore any comments suggesting the use of Stylish!

Themes are organized into folders named the site, then theme name. Each theme is a `.css` file named after the version number

Example:
A version of a theme "Pickletastic" for http://example.com released on April 1st, 2016 would be stored as `example.com/Pickletastic/v16.04.1.css`

If the theme affects multiple sites (unlikely), then the top folder may simply be named after the site owner (Example instead of example.com would be multiple example-owned websites) `Example/Pickletastic/v16.04.1.css`

So in short
`Company or Site/Theme Name/Version.css`
